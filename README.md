  * Tom: _"Do you still play Ã­n your playground?"_
  * Peter: _"Yes, but the `README.md` is out of date?"_
  * Tom: _"Mh, but can I have some information about the progress?"_
  * Peter: _"Sure, just have a look in the [project board](https://trello.com/b/xUlXP4Rm/paula) on trello?"_

## Getting Started (_out of date_)

A couple of things need to be setup, if you want to start Paula yourself.

* Install the Azure Cosmos DB emulator

* Create a `usersecrets.json` for the `data/Migrator` project.

```json
{
  "CosmosEndpoint": "<URI of the Azure Cosmos DB emulator>",
  "CosmosKey": "<Primary Key of the Azure Cosmos DB emulator>",
  "CosmosDatabase": "<Name of the Azure Cosmos DB Database>",
}
```

* Run `data/Migrator` to initialize the database.

* Create a `usersecrets.json` for the `server/ServerApp` project.

```json
{
  "CosmosEndpoint": "<URI of the Azure Cosmos DB emulator>",
  "CosmosKey": "<Primary Key of the Azure Cosmos DB emulator>",
  "CosmosDatabase": "<Name of the Azure Cosmos DB Database>",
  "Maintainer": "<The user that will be the admin>",
  "MaintainerOrganization": "<The organization of the admin user>"
}
```
* Set `server/ServerApp` and `blazor/BlazorServerSideHost` as multiple start projects.
* Run the application (https://localhost:5002) and register a new organization for your maintainer.

## Currenty Status

I'm tracking the progress of the application on the project board.
